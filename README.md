# feathers-nuxt -WIP

## Just a Feathers - Nuxt enviroment.

I took the project generated with the "create-nuxt-app" of the nuxt-community and added the structure of a project generated by the feathers-cli, which you can use.

This way you have a more complete framework, with a structure under the server folder.

Also the dependencies are updated.

It has Vuetify as the frontend.
